A MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) is a multi-user virtual world described entirely by text (see the wiki entry on MUD). MUDs combine elements of role-playing games, interactive fiction and online chat. Originally, MUDs were accessed over the internet via telnet (try telnetting to PennMUSH (a MUSH is a variant of a MUD) by typing telnet mush.pennmush.org 4201 in a terminal). MUDs were extremely popular with undergraduate students in the late 80’s (see the wiki page - during this time it was sometimes said that the MUD acroynm stood for “Multiple Undergraduate Destroyer” due to their popularity amongst students and the amount of time students wasted playing).
In this coursework you are going to extend a MUD engine called ECS-MUD using the node.js platform and deploy it in the cloud using the Heroku service. Rather than using telnet for communication, ECS-MUD will communicate with clients using the new HTLM5 WebSockets feature. We have provided a basic MUD implementation to get you started, although you will need to implement a number of features to complete the game.
